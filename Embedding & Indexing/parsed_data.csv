Computer science (CS) is an exciting, growing and challenging field that impacts every part of our lives. As an introductory course for computer science, this course will not only provide fundamental knowledge of a variety of CS topics, but it will also provide essential computational problem-solving skills with hands on programming experience. This course is an elective course open to everyone, and no specific prerequisites are needed. Successfully completing this course will serve as a solid foundation for other courses in the computer science or data science majors. It can also bring new concepts and tools to other domains in the social sciences, arts, humanities and natural sciences. What background knowledge do I need before taking this course? No specific prerequisites. What will I learn in this course? Upon successful completion of this course, you should achieve competency in the following areas:  Grasp common computing and programming terms and concepts . Employ common programming patterns and abstractions to solve problems in Python  Formulate problems computationally and solve them through programming What will I do in this course? One of the primary goals of this course is for students to be able to write programs from scratch on their own. Especially for those students who have never programmed before, this goal should not be taken lightly. To achieve this, there will be lectures, labs, quiz, homework, mid-term and final exam, as shown below. Lectures You will have 4 lectures a week with Prof. Bing Luo. During the lectures, there will be PowerPoint presentations, mainly on programming principles and algorithms. Each lecture will be recorded and made available as soon as it is ready for those who have trouble with the synchronous lectures. To make your classroom more interactive, there may also be programming activities and Q&A sessions. Hence, you may want to bring your laptops to the lectures. Labs You will have one lab session a week with lab instructor. During the session, you will practice programming on the topics that are covered in the lectures. A short presentation or demonstration of coding might also be given by the instructor. You may seek assistances from the instructor if you encounter difficulties on the practice. Some lab sessions may involve group discussions and collaboration on a task. Homework/Quiz/Projects Homework will be assigned throughout the course. The homework normally has some programming tasks relevant to the contents covered in the lecture. Quizzes will be done during the lecture time. You will work on a few small (mini) projects through the session. More details about these assessments will be confirmed in due course. Note that though you can collaborate and help each, all assignments (quizzes, mini-projects) will be individually graded, so do NOT simply copy and paste (or only with minor modifications) someone else’s code. All work that you submit must be your own. Collaboration is encouraged but must be disclosed by all parties. Source codes found on the Web, if used, must be clearly attributed with a comment. Such code must not solve the core problem of the assignment. Mid-term The in-class test will be covering questions on what you have learnt during the first half of the session. It will mainly consist of multiple-choice questions, and likely some short questions as well. You will be briefed with details about the content and format prior to the test. If you study remotely, the test will be online. More details will be provided in due course. Final exam The exam will be mainly covering the topics you have learnt during the second half of the session, but it may involve the knowledges and questions from the first half. There will be both theoretical and programming questions. Special arrangements for remote students during COVID-19 Students remotely taking the class online are expected to watch lecture videos (PowerPoint presentations) afterwards in case you miss the live session. Our goal is to maintain an inclusive platform and environment for CS101 students. How can I prepare for the class sessions to be successful?  You are encouraged to actively interact with Prof. Bing Luo or TAs during the lectures and labs.  Prof. Bing Luo or TAs will set up office hours, during which you are encouraged to stop them for assistance, before and/or after lectures or labs.  If you demonstrate excellent interaction and active involvement in lectures, lab sessions and peer learning assistance, you will be prioritized to be considered for future peer tutor and/or student teaching/research assistant positions for this and related courses.

After working as a database programmer for several years he switched gears and went into philosophy. He received his M.A. in philosophy of religion at Biola University (2006) and his MPhil / Ph.D. in philosophy of mind from Cambridge University (2011). He taught philosophy at Renmin University in Beijing, China before coming to Duke Kunshan University in 2018. He continues to co-direct the Center for Analytic Philosophy at Renmin University and is overseeing a grant housed there on the Social, Psychological, and Philosophical Implications of AI (2018-2021). What is this course about? Computer science (CS) is an exciting, growing and challenging field that impacts every part of our lives. As an introductory course for computer science, this course will not only provide fundamental knowledge of a variety of CS topics, but it will also provide essential computational problem-solving skills with hands on programming experience. This course is an elective course open to everyone, and no specific prerequisites are needed. Successfully completing this course will serve as a solid foundation for other courses in the computer science or data science majors. It can also bring new concepts and tools to other domains in the social sciences, arts, humanities and natural sciences. We also want you to develop high level skills aligned with DKU’s animating principles: collaborative problem-solving, research and practice, lucid communication, etc. In this course, there is a final group project that encourages collaborative problem-solving. Each week there will also be recitation/lab sessions to encourage group discussion. What background knowledge do I need before taking this course? There are no prerequisites for this course. What will I learn in this course? By the end of this course, you will be able to:  Deploy solid Python programming techniques  Use simple algorithms, data structures, and the notion of complexity  Apply the skills of object-oriented programming and debugging to solve computational problems  Formulate problems computationally  Plan and manage the progress of a programming project in an efficient way  Develop written and oral presentation skills What will I do in this course? Activities: There will be 4 lectures each week: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Each lecture session is 75 minutes long and will include a variety of exercises to accompany the lecture. Each lecture will be recorded and made available as soon as it is ready for those who have trouble with the synchronous lectures. After the first two lectures, each lecture will begin with a daily quiz on previously covered material. After each lecture from weeks 1 to 6, there will be a daily programming assignment that is based on the day’s lecture that are due 24 hours after it is released after lecture. Though you can work together, all assignments will be individually graded. Working together, however, does NOT mean simply sharing code. Though you can discuss strategies, you can simply copy and paste (with minor modifications) someone else’s code. There will be an online programming cloud system to release, collect and automatically (or manually) grade programming assignments, in-class quizzes and mini-projects. There are recitation/lab sessions to review the contents taught during the week and to provide practical insights into programming. From weeks 1 to 5, there will be weekly mini-project released every Thursday and due the following Monday before class. Weekly mini-projects are individual assignments; you should submit your own solution. Starting from"

COMPSCI 101 (S7W1-2021)_3,COMPSCI 101 (S7W1-2021),week 7,", there will be no daily assignments or in-class quizzes. Instead, you should work on your final group projects. You need to join with other students to form a team with a total of three or four group members. The lab sessions during weeks 6 and 7 will be used for final project review and discussion. Final group projects will include: A role-playing game, the connect-four game with AI strategy, a database, Huffman encoding for file compression, topological sorting of degree requirements, social network analysis, etc. Formative Assessments: Generally, there are small in-class quizzes to test whether you understand the concepts and methods taught in the previous lecture; and a daily assignment to assess your understanding of the new material presented that day. These assignments and quizzes will evaluate your understanding and comprehension on essential elements of Python programming, testing and debugging, object-oriented programming, computational complexity, algorithms, and data structures. The 5 weekly mini-projects will evaluate whether you can think computationally and implement programs to solve useful problems in an efficient and effective way. There will also be 2 in-class paper exams: 1. The first will cover Python programming concepts, scoping, and recursion. 2. The second will cover object-oriented programming, complexity, alogirthms, and data structures. After the first paper exam, I will pair each of you with a partner to facilitate group interaction, communication and learning. Summative assessments: The final group project will be used to evaluate your overall computer science related skills (understanding, application, analysis and presentation). How can I prepare for the class sessions to be successful?  You are expected to complete selected textbook readings before the lecture and lab sessions.  You are required to bring your laptop to class for programming activities.  You need to review each day’s content and work on the daily assignments after every lecture.

Previously ran 400+ engineer organizations spanning 4 continents as an Engineering Vice President at IBM before becoming an entrepreneur in the digital health space. Personally written close to half a million lines of code. Ph.D. Computer Science from MIT. What is this course about? To be successful as a computer scientist, certain practical and theoretical skills are needed. In particular, computer scientists need to be proficient at programming. This course is designed to lay this needed foundation, providing students with a mix of hands-on familiarity with writing real programs and mathematical theory for how to write efficient programs. What background knowledge do I need before taking this course? No specific prerequisites, other than general familiarity with computers and knowledge of basic high school mathematics (algebra/pre-calculus). What will I learn in this course? Upon completion, students should achieve competency in the following areas: https://sakai.duke.edu/portal/tool/a7d7b04e-bed9-4c4e-a7e0-1af2caa5a062/printFriendly 1/4 6/3/2021 COMPSCI.201.001L.F19 Use standard Java libraries to design, develop, and test basic Java programs based on a written specification. Efficiently choose and apply standard data structures including arrays, linked lists, maps, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Evaluate the time and space complexity of iterative- and recursively-defined algorithms. What will I do in this course? One of the primary goals of this course is for students to be able to write Java programs, from scratch, on their own. Especially for those students who have never programmed before, this goal should not be taken lightly. To achieve this, there will be three kinds of graded coding assignments given during the semester. Expect to spend a significant amount of time every week on assignments. Note that the amount of credit received for different assignments will vary throughout the course, but, in general, assignments given later in the course will tend to be worth more credit. This is because a meta-goal of this course is to see students demonstrate improvement in their skills as they progress through the course. A different collaboration policy applies for each kind of assignment. Not abiding by the collaboration policy in effect for a given assignment may result in disciplinary action. Individual Labs Certain days will have lab time allotted for students to write small programs on an individual basis. Students may brainstorm with each other and help debug each other’s code, but all submitted code must be written by individual students, and a student’s submitted code may not include code copied from other sources, including other students, websites, etc. Code for these lab assignments will be due at 11:59pm the same day. No credit will be given for labs that are missed; those missed due to an officially-excused absence will be dropped from the final grade calculation. Labs will be given one of four grades: Excellent, Mostly Right, Needs Improvement, or No Credit. Group Labs Some lab assignments will be performed in small groups rather than individually. There will only be one code submission per group, and it is expected that group members help each other to complete the assignment. As with individual labs, code will be due at 11:59pm the same day, and the same late policy and grade structure applies. Individual Homework Homework assignments will be assigned throughout the course. An assignment will earn 80% of the credit it would otherwise have earned if it is turned in late, up to 48 hours after the posted"

This course is an introduction to computer programming for students with a general interest or aspiring in data science and/or computer science majors. The goal of the course is to teach basic principles and practical issues, in an interdisciplinary approach, to introduce the fundamental principles, practices and questions in computer science, programming, and engineering, leading to effective applications in computer science, physics, biology, chemistry, engineering, and other disciplines. Upon successful completion of the course, the students are expected to gain enough background, knowledge and experience to feel comfortable to learn, speak, read and write, think and communicate in computer programming language, basic data-structures and founding principles and methodologies in computer science. Students are expected to be able to apply programming and computer skills in continuing computer science and vast interdisciplinary studies. What background knowledge do I need before taking this course? There is no prerequisite of this course. What will I learn in this course? The course is divided in the following modules:  Java programming language, syntax and semantics, data-types, control structures, input/outputs, abstract data types, functions and libraries and design principles  Data structures for search, sorting, stack, queue, list and graph algorithms/manipulations,  Fundamental questions and models in computer science, finite automata, regular expression, Turing machines, and intractability  Machine structure and assembly programming in TOY  Fundamental concepts in Boolean logic and circuit design What will I do in this course? Traditionally, entry level computer programming emphasize effort in critical thinking and problem- solving skills, which is still going to be the core objective. The primary goals of this course are for students to be able to learn, speak, read and write Java programs and be able to extend that expertise to interdisciplinary application domains and be able to learn other programming languages on their own. Each week, in addition to lectures, recitations and labs, students are required to complete the programming assignments, pre and post class questionnaires for each lecture, and a BirdKan 531 weekly group exercise listed and explained below. In this session, we will incorporate lab-sessions on Thursdays (starting the second week) to be led by student TAs to present supplement materials for the core concepts of the lecture and for preparation of homework questions. Java Programming Assignments (JPA) Following each lecture on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, there will be homework assignments. Monday and Tuesday’s homework is due on Friday midnight and Wednesday’s homework is due on Saturday midnight. Remote online students get an automatic 24-hour extension over DKU local time. No late submissions are to be accepted. Programming assignments are to be graded with SAG (Staged Auto Grading), an auto-grading system developed by a group of DKU students during the summer of 2020. There are potentially weekend programming assignments to be announced as class progresses. Pre-class and post-class work and questionnaire Starting"
COMPSCI 201 (S7W1-2021)_2,COMPSCI 201 (S7W1-2021),week 2,", Before and after each lecture on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, students are required to read Textbook, watch the Coursera videos (posted at course site) and complete a pre- class and a post-class questionnaire. The due date is specified in the following table, pre-class questionnaire is due before class and post-class questionnaire is due on 3rd mid-night after class (the same due time as JPA). Each week, students are required to submit N-2 such questionnaire pairs, where N is the number of lectures in that week. Lecture Day Questionnaire Due Time Monday Pre-class Monday (before class) Monday Post-class Thursday 11:59pm (Monday HW due) Tuesday Pre-class Tuesday (before class) Tuesday Post-class Friday 11:59pm (Tuesday HW due) Wednesday Pre-class Wednesday (before class) Wednesday Post-class Saturday 11:59pm (Wednesday HW due) BirdKan 531 Weekly Group Project Each week, the whole class are divided into 4-student focus groups. Each group is asked to create a 5-minute presentation with maximum 3 slides to focus about one “thing” (hence call it BK-531) as a weekend project. However, each has the option to deliver extra content and materials to supplement/strengthen the slide sets and the presentation. Students can opt to adopt a different presentation format other than slides if they believe so strongly. Starting the second week, on Thursday lectures, two students of each group will conduct a presentation collaboratively to the class. Members of each focus group will be announced no later than the end of every Thursday. Therefore, the ‘group-portion’ of the weekly group project officially starts when group memberships are announced, the time before that is for individual study and preparation. Teaching staff has the authority to decide to change or keep the previous week’s focus group arrangement, as the session progresses. During the 7-week session, each student is expected to present three times. The topics and themes of the BK-531 are to be selected by each group with option guidance from the teaching staff. There is only one requirement that the content of BK-531 deliverables needs be related (at least remotely related) to the course material covered in that week. In general, a major source of the topics can be from textbooks reading, lectures, exercises, (forum) discussions with other students and teaching staff, or any of your previous experience/knowledge that is related. In other words, without the experiences in the last week, the end-product of the BK-531 would not be possible. A starting point to think of the BirdKan 531 exercise is analogous to a MindMeister mind-map of a particular topic learned/studied in the past week (or weeks). Keep in mind that MindMeister can just be a starting reference point, a lot can be achieved in 5 minute 3 slides due to the particulars in a computer science and programming. As mentioned earlier, the BK-531 deliverable is an end-product but also can be a starting point, students are free to create extra content and materials (in any form of choice) to supplement and strengthen the aspired BK-531 objectives. In general, it would improve the perceived performance/evaluation if the presenter shall conduct dry- runs before Monday to prepare for the 5-minute presentation, other equally important (background) factors are justifications of effort, team spirit/work, deliverables, impact, depth and width of the technical content/contribution, ingenuity/creativity, artistic and innovative elements, and passion. Students shall decide and work on things that they felt strongly interested and worth their time and effort to share with the rest of the class. There will be a short Q/A session after each presentation. Special arrangements for remote students during COVID-19 Students remotely taking the class will work the focus group to find a suitable time for group discussions. Presentation can be in the form of video and course staff may host a separate session for remote students to give the presentation live. Our goal is to maintain an inclusive platform and environment for CS201 students. How can I prepare for the class sessions to be successful?  Completing the pre and post class questionnaires in quality time will not only help you with lecture materials, but also gives you inspiration when working on the weekly BirdKan 531 project in a group setting  Students who cannot attend lecture synchronously are expected to watch lecture videos afterwards.  Teaching staff and ARC will setup daily homework lab/office hours to assist students  Students are seriously encouraged to utilize piazza online to post course related questions and answers (no coding solution though). See grading section for letter grade upgrade policy over piazza contributions.  Students who demonstrate exceptional participation in lectures, recitation, homework lab sessions and peer learning assistance are prioritized to be considered for future peer tutor and/or student worker/teaching/research assistant positions for this and related courses. What required texts, materials, and equipment will I need? Required Textbook. R. Sedgewick and K. Wayne, Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach, Addison–Wesley Professional, 2016. ISBN 978-0134076423. We will be referencing this text all semester. The lectures are based on its contents. How will my grade be determined? A student’s final grade will be determined from the following weighting with potential letter grade upgrade described as follows: Assignments (each homework is weighted equally) 50% Midterm (in class on Monday 2/1/2021) 20% Final exam (comprehensive) 30% A+= 98% - 100% A = 97% - 93%; A- = 90% - 92%; B+ = 87% - 89%; B = 83% - 86%; B- = 80% - 82%; C+ = 77% - 79%; C = 73% - 76%; C- = 70% - 72%; D+ = 67% - 69%; D = 63% - 66%; D- = 60% - 62% F = 59% and below The following are the letter-grade upgrade policy. Pre/Post Class Questionnaires Ranking Details of the questionnaire and grading criterion will be released during class. These questionnaires (not quiz’s) will be graded by course staff and rank the submissions into two groups, where one group’s submission is significantly of better quality and effort than the other, we call the better performed group as group Q. The percentage of students in group Q is contingent on the overall quality distribution of the particular week’s submission. It is possible if every submission did well, then group Q can include everyone who has submitted the questionnaire. Students accumulate weekly Q points from each submission: 1. For each submission ranked in group Q, student will earn 2 points. 2. For submissions not ranked in group Q but demonstrated limited/acceptable effort, student will earn 1 point 3. No submission or submissions warrantees no qualified effort, student get 0 points 4. The best N-2 questionnaire pairs will be used for grading. N is the number of lectures in the week. We will then rank the weekly-Q points into 3 groups, and assign Q-ranks: Q1, Q2 and Q3 with Q1 has highest weekly Q-points and Q3 has the lowest Q points. The cut point will vary weekly based on the actual raw distribution to demonstrate a clear difference of quality/effort and result. We will announce the classification formula in class. The significance of the weekly Q-rank will be clear in the next BirdKan section. Students in different time zones outside China will have the due date adjusted accordingly. BirdKan 531 Project Ranking For each presentation on Monday lecture, the evaluation takes place and will follow a voting approach as in the American Idol(美国偶像） or I am a Singer(我是歌手) show, where a weighted score is calculated from the votes by students, tutors, TAs and other teaching staff. The exact evaluation guidelines and formulation of the weights and weighted scoring scheme are to be announced during class. At the end of evaluation, all groups will be ranked together and earn BK-stars: 1. Groups in the top 30%, each member will earn 8 BK-stars 2. Groups between 30% and 70%, each member will earn 4 BK-stars 3. The rest get 1 star 4. For individuals whose above Q-ranking (see above questionnaire section) is Q1, they can earn 2 extra stars, and earn 1 star if they are Q2-ranked, however, the maximum possible number of stars earned per week is 8. By the end of the semester, the total BK-stars will be accumulated which will compete for a partial letter grade upgrade, see the grading section for details. By now, if you are curious what BirdKan stands for, come to the first class. Letter Grade Upgrade Policy  Piazza Contribution Upgrade (PCU): In order to facilitate contribution in piazza forum, top N percent piazza contributors (largely according to piazza statistics of contribution but teaching staff has the right to decide/interpret the final ranking and define tie-breaking policy) would receive an 1/3rd letter grade upgrade to their final grade, e.g. an A- can be upgraded to A and so forth, with the following special considerations: 1. In order to upgrade from A to A+, piazza contribution must be ranked in top N/2 percent. 2. The final cut-off percentage N will be determined to the end of session based on actual participation. In the past, only 20% of the students are active on piazza. The objective of the upgrade policy is to encourage students write up their questions, answers and posts in a clear, succinct and thoughtful way onto the Piazza online forum, which has been becoming essential for efficient and collaborative learning in the current era.  BirdKan Ranking (BK-Ranking) Upgrade: Students will be ranked (refer it as bk-ranked) according to the accumulated BK-stars obtained in pre and post class questionnaire and the weekly BirdKan 531exercise and the Monday presentations. 1. The top 20% bk-ranked will qualify for a 2/3rd of a letter grade upgrade 2. Those bk-ranked between 20% and 80% percentile will be qualified to obtain a 1/3rd letter grade upgrade with the following special considerations a. To upgrade from A to A+ or A- to A, students needs be in top 20% percentile overall b. To upgrade from A- to A+, B+ to A, students needs be in top 15% percentile overall Actual percentile and percentage setting can fluctuate and will be announced to the end of the session. For tie-breaking considerations, we will use the following formula as the key to the BirdKan ranking/sorting function: (total BK-stars, total weekly Q-points, JPA score, final exam raw score). Max Upgrade Policy: Combining PCU and BK-Ranking, the maximum allowed upgrade is 2/3rd of a letter grade, in observation to the above special considerations. Special considerations for students remotely taking the course Lectures and recitation will be conducted on campus and video-recorded for later viewing. Due to scheduling conflicts with other courses and the wide geological distribution of students, we will not be able to change the time of lectures. Remote students will have to watch the videos in order to keep up the course progress. Teaching staff and ARC will work together to arrange specific office hours, tutor time and formats to accommodate students in different time-zone. Students participate in a group exercises are to resolve the time-zone difference within each individual group. What are the course policies? Communications: For any questions regarding the course, you are free to send email to Jiang and Xue. There will be daily office hours from TA and course instructors. The best way to get prompt help outside office and lab hours is to post the question on piazza. Student participation in forum discussions will be considered when applying for peer tutor and student worker positions. The teaching staff and ARC support will arrange tutor and TA support for students in different time zones. Due date will be adjusted to student’s time zone location to accommodate students who are remotely taking the course. Discussion Guidelines: Civility is an essential ingredient for academic discourse. All communications for this course should be conducted constructively, civilly, and respectfully. Differences in beliefs, opinions, and approaches are to be expected. Please bring any communications you believe to be in violation of this class policy to the attention of your instructor. Active interaction with peers and your instructor is essential to success in this course, paying particular attention to the following:  Be respectful of others and their opinions, valuing diversity in backgrounds, abilities, and experiences.  Challenging the ideas held by others is an integral aspect of critical thinking and the academic process. Please word your responses carefully and recognize that others are expected to challenge your ideas. A positive atmosphere of healthy debate is encouraged.

This course is an introduction to computer organization and architecture for students with a general interest or aspiring in Data Science major and the computer science tracks of the Applied Mathematics & Computational Sciences major and the Computation & Design major. Today processors are used in all forms of electronic equipment and hence the course is relevant for computer engineers as well as software developers designing cross-platform embedded systems and IoT services where they are often important to make efficient use of the resources of the processor in order to optimize performance, cost, and energy consumption. The goal of the course is to teach basic computer principles and practical issues, to introduce the fundamental principles, practices and solutions in computer design, programming, and engineering. This course will be interesting to students who want to understand at a more foundational level how computers work. This course will provide students the opportunity to study and evaluate a modern computer organization design. It covers topics in fundamentals of computer design, MIPS instruction set design, computer arithmetic, processor implementation, pipelining, memory hierarchy, and performance evaluation. It is the core courses in computer engineering fields which offer an interdisciplinary approach that will train our undergraduate students to thrive in a highly competitive technical workforce. What background knowledge do I need before taking this course? Prerequisite: COMPSCI 201 Introduction to Programming and Data Structures You are supposed to equip enough background in computer programming language, basic data-structures, and founding principles and methodologies taught in COMPSCI 201. What will I learn in this course? During weekly lectures, you are expected to learn the organizational structure that determines the capabilities and performance of computer systems, to understand the interactions between the computer’s architecture and its software, and to evaluate trade-offs between the design cost and system performance. A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to: 1. Identify the essential parts of the computer structure that determines the capability and performance of computer systems. 2.

What will I do in this course? According to the abovementioned course learning objectives, we develop the following course activities to assess if you are able to demonstrate your mastery of different learning objectives in this course. Collaborative Notes Taking: You will work together to provide a set of notes to share with the entire class. There would be 2 or more notetakers working on the course note preparation for each lecture. You are expected to complete two course notes as assigned and post them one day after the lecture on the Sakai site. Your notes may be commented and polished by other course students. The notes taking grade will be assigned by checked for completion manner: full credit if you did the work “to a reasonable standard”, no credit if you didn’t. Simulation: The simulation tasks will help you have a better understanding of how to implement the theoretical computer organization and programming language principles using the simulators. You will obtain hands-on experiences and demonstrate that you can analyze and apply your course knowledge in simulation experiments, including practicing with MIPS simulator, MIPS Pipeline simulator, Cache simulator using the textbook examples and the simulation tutorials prepared by the instructor. Simulation will be given biweekly on Thursday and you will need to submit your simulation results by Sunday midnight. Assignment: The goal of the assignment is to prepare you for the midterm exam. Your assignments include describing aspects of computer structure and questions about changing some aspects of the pipeline control structure and memory hierarchy. You will receive an assignment two weeks before the midterm exam. Each assignment will be due at the week of the midterm exam and the assignment solution will be provided before each midterm exam so that you can review the assignment solution before the midterm exam (on Thu). In-class Midterm Exam and Make-up Question Design: There will be THREE midterm exams. Exam 1 covers Chapter 2-3, Exam 2 covers Chapter 4, and Exam 3 covers Chapter 5. After each exam, you will have the opportunity to boost your midterm grade by designing ONE new challenging exam question and answer (5-10 bonus points). Comprehensive Final Exam: A comprehensive final exam will be designed to test students’ overall understanding of the whole course materials. It is designed to be a comprehensive exam with a longer exam time. It covers basically everything you have learned from this class. Case Study Final Report: Our lectures, take home assignments, simulation sessions, and exams will equip you necessary skill and knowledge to investigate modern computer design, programming, and engineering applications. By the end of the class, you will be requested to explore modern computer and embedded system design as your case study. You should describe the needs, market scale, state of the art, chip design trade-off, and the potential applications in your final report. Please prepare your planned case study early and discuss your intermediate findings in our individual meetings or using Sakai site discussion board. How can I prepare for the class sessions to be successful?  Prior reading of the textbook materials before class is always highly recommended.  It is your responsibility to check the course website for any important announcements. You will need to download course slides, assignments, simulations, and any other necessary information from Sakai site.  It is recommended that you should start to work on every assigned course work early.  Late coursework submissions (course notes, assignments, simulations, and the final report) will not be accepted unless you communicate with me prior to the due day and/or with a documented excuse.  After each midterm exam grade is announced, you are encouraged to craft ONE new challenging exam question and answer as an optional bonus (5-10 bonus points) to boost your midterm grade.  It is recommended that you never leave blank to any questions and always submit your work on time.

If you want to be a world-class programmer, you can do programming for ten years or programming for two years and take an algorithm class.”. This course aim to build a solid foundation in the basic questions and techniques in algorithmic analysis, theory, design and implementation for correctness and performance. Databases, in its general sense, is about organizing, managing and manipulating a collection or collections of digitized information. Databases are so prevalent today that they are behind almost all websites, banking system, online booking systems, mobile apps, pretty much all software system maintains some amount of persistent information. This course aims to give a solid background in database systems, from understanding and specifying user requirement to theory, design and implementation of such systems. Topics include data modeling, database design theory, data definition and manipulation languages (SQL), storage and indexing, query processing and optimization, parallel and distributed data processing, transaction processing, concurrency and recovery. Specific for data science students, this section is about the ‘data’ side (data management in computer science terms) of the story, which is a prerequisite and stepping-stone to get to study/research any of the ‘sciences’, derived from the data. What background knowledge do I need before taking this course? This course requires student have previous learning in CompSci 201 or equivalent and background knowledge in basic probability theory. All students are advised to read the Appendix A-D from the CLRS textbook. What will I learn in this course? The course is divided in two parts. After the algorithm section you should be able to apply the following fundamental tools in computer science algorithm design and analysis and from that, you should be a better programmer:  Conduct asymptotic analysis of algorithm and solving recurrences  Apply divide and conquer framework in sorting algorithms and order statistics problems  Design hashing and binary search trees for efficient look up procedures.  Utilize Greedy algorithm and dynamic programming framework for algorithmic optimizations  Apply the techniques in graph representation and solve graph algorithms such as shortest path and max-flow problems. After completing the database section, you will be able to:  Use relational algebra and database modeling to design and manipulate database theoretically  Learn to use SQL to program databases.  Use E/R modeling, functional dependency and normal forms to do efficient database design from real life situations What will I do in this course? For detailed course schedule please visit: http://repolab.colab.duke.edu/courses/cs301/#/site/schedule Individual Homework Homework will be assigned throughout the course. Coding assignments will be auto-graded using SAG system. No late submission will be accepted. Students may help each other subject to the rule that no student is permitted to show code he/she wrote to others. In other words, students may talk with one another about problem solving approaches and concepts, but code for individual homework assignments must be individually created. Students are encouraged to goto OH and tutor hours, and utilize Edstem.org forum for course related discussions. Students are encouraged to ask questions in class and off class.

COMPSCI 301 (S7W2-2022)_3,COMPSCI 301 (S7W2-2022),week 4,"-5, students are divided into group of four to complete an open-topic project and deliver a presentation in class on Wednesday’s and compete for letter-grade upgrades at session end. To encourage teamwork, project continuity and coherence, each group will work on the project for two weeks. In the first week, each team will deliver a presentation which constitutes a proposal. In the following week, the team shall present the progress and resulting deliverables. Each presentation should end with two quiz questions to test the audiences understanding of the presented material. We employ a voting approach to the grading as those seen in ‘I am Singer’ or ‘American Idol’ where votes from audience (fellow students) and judges (teaching staff) will be combined in a weighted-sum to rank each group’s performance. Each week, based on the ranking, the top 30 percentile will earn 8 bk-stars, the lowest 30 percentile will earn 3 bk-stars, while those in the middle earn 5 bk-stars. Percentile cut-off may fluctuate depending on the overall quality distribution of the week (e.g. for tie-breaking situations). Overall, the grading rubrics cover the following aspects - Slides - Presentation - Scholarly/Original - Ingenuity/Coverage of the quizzes (Q/A) - Teamwork - Risk taking and integrity of the effort - Project proposal rating (for 1st week) - Project continuity rating (for 2nd week) Letter-grade upgrade policy: At the end of session, students’ bk-ranking is obtained from ranking the accumulated weekly bk-stars. Students in the top 25 percentile is eligible to 2/3rd letter-grade upgrade, students in the middle 25-80 percentile is eligible for 1/3rd letter grade upgrade, the lowest 20 percentile is not eligible for upgrade. Special considerations apply: 1. To upgrade to the letter grade to A, the session bk-star ranking must be in the top 10% percentile. 2. To upgrade to the letter grade to A-, the session bk-star ranking must be in the top 25% percentile. 3. In addition, students with raw letter grade B+/A- can only be upgraded to A-/A respectively (in this case, 2/3rd is reduced to 1/3rd letter grade upgrade at the A- and A level). How can I prepare for the class sessions to be successful?  Prior reading of the textbook materials before class is always highly recommended  Students who cannot attend lecture synchronously are expected to watch lecture videos afterwards.  Teaching staff and ARC will setup daily homework lab/office hours to assist students  Students who shows exceptional participation in lectures, recitation, homework lab sessions and peer learning assistance are prioritized to be considered for future peer tutor and/or student worker positions for this and related courses. What required texts, materials, and equipment will I need? There are two required textbooks for this course: 1. Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd ed. by Thomas Corman, Charles Leiserson, Ronald Rivest, and Clifford Stein. MIT Press, 2009. ISBN: 9780262033848 2. Database System Concepts, 7th Edition, by Avi Silberschatz, Henry F. Korth, S. Sudarshan. McGraw-Hill, March, 2019. ISBN 9780078022159 The first book is accessible online at Duke library for all students. How will my grade be determined? The raw letter graded is assigned based on your assignments and final exam. . Assignments 50% Final exam (comprehensive) 50% Please refer to the following scale for your grading. A+= 98% - 100% A = 97% - 93%; A- = 90% - 92%; B+ = 87% - 89%; B = 83% - 86%; B- = 80% - 82%; C+ = 77% - 79%; C = 73% - 76%; C- = 70% - 72%; D+ = 67% - 69%; D = 63% - 66%; D- = 60% - 62% F = 59% and below What are the course policies? Communications: For any questions regarding the course, you are free to send email to cs301-staff- fall2020@dukekunshan.edu.cn. There will daily office hours from TA and course instructors.

Speech recognition systems invoke concepts from a variety of fields including speech production, linear algebra, probability and statistics, information theory, linguistics, pattern recognition and various aspects of computer science. In this course we take a project based approach. We present speech recognition systems through the perspective of a novice. Beginning from the very simple problem of matching two strings, we present the algorithms and techniques as a series of intuitive and logical increments, until we arrive at a fully functional continuous speech recognition system. At the meantime, we will also cover the theoretical foundations and present the essential algorithms from the theoretic point of view which could link to the general machine learning and pattern recognition theory. Following the philosophy that the best way to understand a topic is to work on it, the course will be project oriented, combining formal lectures with required hands-on work. Students will be required to work on a series of projects of increasing complexity. Each project will build on the previous project, such that the incremental complexity of projects will be eminently doable. At the end of the course, merely by completing the series of projects students would have built their own fully-functional speech recognition systems. Moreover, state-of-the-art speech recognition methods and toolkits will also be introduced at the end of this course. Students will have chance to use open source database and toolkits to build a high quality speech recognition engine by themselves. What background knowledge do I need before taking this course? Pre-requisites: STATS 302 Principles of Machine Learning Coding Skills: This course will require significant programming from the students. Students should be familiar with linux shell script and be able to program fluently in Python. What will I learn in this course? By the end of this course, you will be able to: Manage classical speech recognition techniques, including data capture, feature extraction, string matching, dynamic time warping, hidden Markov modeling, Gaussian mixture modeling, segmental k-means, grammars, finite state grammar, context free grammar, n-gram language model, expected maximization algorithm, maximum likelihood estimation, parametric estimation, backpointer table, subword units, tie states, lattice and rescoring. Implement a classicial continuous speech recognition system using your own code Employ open source database and toolkits to build a high quality speech recognition engine Evaluate whether the selected methods and experimental results are reasonable Develop written and oral presentation skills What will I do in this course? Activities: There will be 2 lecture sessions each week on Tuesday and Thursday. Each lecture session is 150 minutes long. Also there is one 60 min recitation session every week that is designed for students to present their projects and discussion. Evaluations: The first five projects are with increasing complexity. Each project will build on the previous projects, , such that the incremental complexity of projects will be doable. By completing the series of projects 1-5, students would have built their own fully-functional classicial speech recognition systems. Students can complete the first five projects on their own laptops, with Python 3, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook installed. The last two projects will use a different approach. Students are going to explore and employ open source database and toolkits to build a high quality modern speech recognition engine. For projects 6-7, students need to work on CPU virtual machines provided by the university (DKU VPN required). Students are going to work on projects in teams. Ideally, every team contains two students. Every team is required to present their weekly project in the recitation session ("
